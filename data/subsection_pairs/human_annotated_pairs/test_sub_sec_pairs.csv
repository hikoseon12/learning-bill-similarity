education program APHA calls for repealing current Federal funding for abstinence only programs and replacing it with funding for a new Federal program to promote comprehensive sexuality education combining information about abstinence with age appropriate sexuality education 30 Comprehensive sex education programs respect the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community and will complement and augment the sex education children receive from their families 31 Over 60 percent of the 56 300 annual new cases of HIV infections in the United States occur in youth ages 13 through 24 African American and Latino youth have been disproportionately affected by the HIV AIDS epidemic In 2005 Blacks and Latinos accounted for 84 percent of all new HIV infections among 13 to 19 year olds and 76 percent of HIV infections among 20 to 24 year olds in the United States even though together they represent only about 32 percent of people in these ages Teens in the United States contract an estimated 9 000 000 sexually transmitted infections each year By age 24 at least 1 in 4 sexually active people between the ages of 15 and 24 will have contracted a sexually transmitted infection 32 Approximately 50 young people a day an average of two young people every hour of every day are infected with HIV in the United States 33 In 1990 Congress passed the Medicaid Anti Discriminatory Drug Price and Patient Benefit Restoration Act to ensure that Medicaid receives the lowest drug prices in the marketplace Congress intentionally protected the practice of pharmaceutical companies offering charitable organizations and clinics nominally priced drugs As an unintended consequence of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 birth control prices have skyrocketed for millions of women who depend on safety net providers for their birth control Birth control that previously cost only 5 to 10 per month is now prohibitively expensive running as much as 40 or 50 a month Many family planning health centers have absorbed much of this price increase further straining already limited resources As the economic crisis worsens women and their families are increasingly turning to health care safety,doubling the current global investment for both would reduce maternal mortality by 70 percent and deaths to newborns by 44 percent These goals can be achieved for 1 500 000 000 less than the cost of achieving maternal and newborn health alone Every dollar invested in family planning saves 1 40 in maternal and newborn health care services 14 Worldwide women of childbearing age account for more than half of people living with HIV AIDS Integrating reproductive health services including family planning with HIV prevention programs such as those for voluntary counseling and testing and prevention of mother to child transmission is essential to effectively combating HIV AIDS and other STIs 15 The world is witnessing the largest generation of young people in history almost half of the world s population some 3 000 000 000 people is under the age of 25 Unmet need for sexual and reproductive health services is highest among this age cohort Fewer than 5 percent of the poorest sexually active youth use modern contraception 16 The WHO has identified unsafe sex as the second most important risk factor for disability and death among young people in the world s poorest communities Forty five percent of all new HIV infections occur among young people 17 Sixty percent of unsafe abortions in Africa 42 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and 30 percent in Asia are performed on women under the age of 25 18 The WHO has identified a 4 pronged approach to preventing HIV infection in infants which includes prevention of unintended pregnancy among HIV infected women as a key strategy to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV 19 According to the United States Agency for International Development enabling HIV positive women who want to avoid a pregnancy with contraceptive services can prevent an additional 55 000 child deaths and avert more than 150 000 unintended pregnancies in high HIV prevalence countries 20 Demographic factors exacerbate problems related to environmental sustainability The past century of population growth has put increasing pressure on natural resources as the scale of human needs and activities expands At the same time

any development activity in support of commercially developed crew transportation systems the Administrator shall ensure that at a minimum the following steps are completed A Human rating requirements Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act the Administrator shall develop and make publicly available detailed human ratings requirements to guide the design of commercially developed crew transportation capabilities The requirements shall be at least equivalent to proven requirements in use as of the date of enactment of this Act B Commercial market assessment The Administrator shall initiate using an appropriate and qualified independent entity an assessment of the potential non government market for commercially developed crew and cargo space transportation systems and capabilities The assessment shall i include activities associated with potential private sector utilization of International Space Station research and technology development capabilities and other potential activities in low Earth orbit and ii be completed and provided to the committees of jurisdiction no later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act C Procurement system review The Administrator shall review established government procurement and acquisition practices and processes including Space Act Agreement authorities to determine the most cost effective means of procuring commercial crew capabilities and related services which will ensure appropriate accountability transparency and maximum efficiency in the procurement of such services The review shall include a description of proposed measures to address risk management processes and the means of indemnification for third party commercial entities and processes for quality control safety oversight and application of Federal oversight processes within the jurisdiction of other Federal agencies A description of the proposed procurement process and justification for its selection shall be included in any proposed initiation of procurement activity for commercially developed crew transportation services and shall be subject to review by the committees of jurisdiction before the initiation of any competitive process to procure such services In support of the committee review the Comptroller General shall undertake an assessment of the review required by this subparagraph and provide a report,to the committees of jurisdiction within 90 days after the date on which the Administrator provides the description and justification to the committees of jurisdiction D Use of government

to proceed to procurement of commercially developed crew transportation systems or capabilities 3 Sense of the congress It is the sense of the Congress that the development of commercial capabilities for the use of space may be of value in maximizing the utility and productivity of the International Space Station by providing a commercial means of enabling crew transfer and crew rescue services for the International Space Station The Congress further believes that once such commercial services have demonstrated the capability to meet established ascent entry and International Space Station proximity operations safety requirements the United States should make use of domestic commercially provided crew transfer and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable The Congress further believes that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should expedite where possible the use of domestic commercially provided International Space Station cargo missions and that upon the certification by appropriate Federal agencies of operational flight readiness for the provision of commercial crew transportation capabilities the Administrator should limit to the maximum extent practicable the use of a United States Government crew transportation vehicle to missions carrying crew beyond low Earth orbit 4 Limitation on obligation or expenditure of funds No funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act may be obligated or expended for the purpose of procuring a commercially developed crew transportation vehicle prior to completion of the requirements of
